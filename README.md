* SkyScanner API used to look up flights

## Working with API
---
* Create an API key [here](http://en.business.skyscanner.net/en-gb/products/travel-apis/)
* Create key.js file in the server folder
* In key.js, paste and replace with your own API key
```sh
module.exports = {
 api_key: â€œYOUR API KEY HERE"
}
